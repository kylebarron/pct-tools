# Downloading websites for offline use

I anticipate wanting to read some websites while on the trail without internet access. In this folder are some scripts that use `wget` to recursively download a website for offline viewing.

I run the scripts to generate an archive of the website and then copy them to iCloud/Dropbox/etc in order to store them offline on my phone. I then open the files with the amazing [Documents app](https://readdle.com/documents) for full website viewing offline.

**Note**: These scripts are for personal non-commercial use.
